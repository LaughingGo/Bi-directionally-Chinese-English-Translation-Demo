# Translate-EN-ZH
This repo concisely demonstrates how to integrate a translation tool based on the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformersï¼‰. Here I'll take Chinese and English as examples.

## Two steps you just need to do
* To modify the *model_name* according to your need. In my demo, the *model_name* are 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en' and 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-zh' respectively. While you could download the corresponding pretrained model from [Here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/hugging-face-models/Helsinki-NLP/) by offline.
* Just run the demo!
